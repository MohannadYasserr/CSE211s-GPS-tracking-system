# CSE211s-GPS-tracking-system.
GPS tracking system for course CSE211s:Intro To Embedded Systems.                                                                        
The objective of this project is to create an embedded system using C programming. This system will continuously acquire real-time positional coordinates while a microcontroller is in motion, specifically utilizing the GPS tracking system with the TM4C123G LaunchPad. 
The project is implemented using the following hardware:
1) Tiva-c
2) NEO6 GPS Module
3) LCD
